# GIS Simulation Explorer

## Purpose

Build a GIS environment based visualization for large scale spatial simulations on the web. 

## Background (Draft)

The current COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the lives of arguably billions around the globe. The ongoing tensions caused by the pandemic has revealed holes in local, national, and global plans for handling outbreaks. Even with all the warnings noted by Canada's pandemic preparedness report ([Federal Government of Canada, 2006](https://www.longwoods.com/articles/images/Canada_Pandemic_Influenza.pdf)), medical supplies were limited and health systems were not adequately suited to handle spikes in hospital admission. 

[Projected effects of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions to prevent resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/37/E1053)

Geographical tracking and mapping of pandemic data through the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has been proven to be a powerful system for disease monitoring and planning ([Buolos & Geraghty, 2020](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8)). Such a system allows researchers to present large volumes of data in an intuitive way. For one, web-based mapping has created an environment for accessible remote collaboration between decision makers ([Franch-Pardo et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720335531)). By integrating simulation models into map-based web applications, researchers can also highlight spatio-temporal trends in various scenarios. 

Modern open-source GIS libraries, such as OpenLayers, provide developers with the necessary tools to load and display data into dynamic map-based web applications. OpenLayers' is entirely free, easy to customize, and supports vector data rendering. D3JS, a lightweight data visualization library, also has some limited mapping capability that could be incorporated into a map-based web application. 

#### Evolution of GIS Web Applications

In many forms of interdisciplinary research, the diverse field of Geography proves most useful. Through use of GIS, researchers can utilize web GIS platforms and software to better analyze, conceptualize, and interpret information. Regardless of the discipline research is being conducted in, if the research data contains spatial components then GIS will be there as a major facilitator in some form **(fix grammar here)** ([Rickles, et al., 2017](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.46)).

#### The Current Work Climate and Remote Collaboration

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers were forced to quickly adapt to having employees work from home (WFH), serve as essential, or simply be laid-off ([Kniffin, et al., 2020](https://doi.apa.org/fulltext/2020-58612-001.html)). One might hypothesize, based on rising trends ([Felstead & Henseke, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ntwe.12097)), many jobs in the digital sphere were already heading towards optionally remote or completely remote before the catalytic event that is the COVID-19 pandemic. The new norm of working from home may allow employers to focus more on merits and qualifications of their candidates rather than whether they live in the correct city. The geographical hurdles once faced by a company's growth and operations, or a person's career choices may be a thing of the past in the near future since employers can focus on offering flexible arrangement ([McCausland, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08956308.2020.1813506)). The current confinement / restrictions set in place for businesses and academic institutions have left many scrambling for effective communicative and collaborative tools ([Brynes, et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ca.23649)). Later in the paper, the GIS Simulation Explorer will be touched on as a remotely accessible collaborative tool for practitioners, and other decision makers. 

#### Application of the GIS Simulation Explorer 

To support current studies of COVID-19 (as well as future pandemics), such an open-source application will be available on the web for remote collaboration. In the GIS Simulation Explorer's current state, simulation results are mapped to vector files, and then displayed for observation. The OpenLayers library supports...

(summarize the points to maybe show why software such as this is useful if implemented on a global scale?)

- Where do we fit in? How did we accomplish it?


## Getting Started:

### Users
[![gif](/app-gis/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaeGtoMDUQ)
- Open the [GIS Simulation Explorer](https://staubibr.github.io/arslab-web/app-gis/index.html) in Chrome 
- OpenStreetMap will automatically load the world map
- Before Loading Simulations
  - You can change the number of classes and color scale
- Load Simulation 
  1. Click the database icon in the map's sidebar
  2. Drag and Drop your simulation results (.txt) and layer (.geojson)
  3. Click the `Load Simulation` button
  4. OPTIONAL: Repeat step 2 to 3
- Manipulating Simulations
  - Click the filter icon in the sidebar
  - By default, the current simulation to be manipulated is the most recently loaded one
  - The current simulation can be selected which will allow you to:
    - Download simulation object as a csv file
    - Cycle through different timestamps of the SIR simulation
    - Change legend
    - Change color
- Download Simulation
  - Click the download icon in the sidebar
  - Choose which simulation to download
  - Click the `Download` button
- Interacting with Simulations Shown on Map
    - View attributes by clicking census subdivisions
- Layer switcher 
  - Click the second icon in the top right corner of the Application
  - Use this for changing between simulations (view-only)
- Search 
  - Click the search icon shown in the Application
  - You can move anywhere on the map by typing in a location
- Playback 
  - Click the play button in the sidebar 
  - This will give you the ability to record the Application as it goes through simulation cycles

### Developers
##### Essentials:
- Download [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)
- Open [app-gis](https://github.com/staubibr/arslab-dev/tree/master/app-gis) in your preferred text editor 
- Use [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) for debugging
  - Ensure that cache is disabled in DevTools

##### Running the local server:
> Open Chrome and go to Apps

>> Click Web Server

>>> Set the current folder to /arslab-dev 

>>>> Open Web Server for Chrome by clicking the Web Server URL

![Web Server.](/app-gis/img/webserver.png "Web Server image.")

##### Development:

Features: 
  - OpenStreetMap as base layer / canvas
    - Zoom in/out
    - Layer Switcher
    - Search bar
    - Sidebar 
      - Home 
      - Load Simulation 
      - Manipulating Simulations
        - Color
        - Classes
        - SIR
      - Download Simulation
      - Playback
    - Legend
    - Interacting with Simulations Shown on Map

##### Structure of Simulation Results Text File:
    State for model _DAUID is <population, number of susceptible, number of infected, number of recovered, number of new infected, number new recovered, number fatalities>
    
    Note:

    - The population changes throughout the results file. 

    - The geojson file you loaded would likely have the initial population for the census subdivision.
    
    - The population formula is (population - population * fatalities)

## TODO:
1. General bug fixes, UI changes, and code refactoring 
2. Update instructional video demo 
3. Fix mapOnClick
   - Code gets wanky when layers are on top of each other
   - The issue could likely be fixed by looking at the layer switcher
4. Let users title their simulation 
5. Let users choose what their simulation object will contain
6. Add options to the Settings tab
   - Support for multiple languages 
7. Allow geopackage files as an accepted file format
   - Look into [GeoPackage JS](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-js)
   - For now use [MyGeodata Converter](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/gpkg-to-geojson) or QGIS to convert .gpkg to .geojson
   - Could also create a [Python script](https://www.geodose.com/2020/06/pyqgis-tutorial-shapefile-conversion.html) for the time being?
8. Fix GeoCoder so it does not add itself as a layer
   - Also maybe use a different GeoCoder? The current one seems to break often if using AdBlock
9. Integrate with DEVS Web Viewer
   - Incorporate library of models w/ backend
10. Introduce spatial analysis tools
