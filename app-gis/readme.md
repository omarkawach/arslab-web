##### GIS

What is it? What can it do?


What can GIS reveal in data? 

In Geography, there are various forms of thematic mapping. For the sake of this paper, the focus will be on choropleth maps as the thematic map for presenting the COVID-19 spread model from simulation results. By shading affected regions by proportion or other statistical variables, users can recognize the impact of COVID-19 within a geographic region.

##### Evolution of GIS and GIS Web Applications

As any experienced geographer today would know, spatio-temporal analysis involves the inquiry into the relationship between space and time. In 1854, epidemiologist Dr. John Snow was the first to exemplify this phenomena by creating a spatial risk model that listed incidences of cholera outbreak ([Caplan, et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105112/#:~:text=John%20Snow%20was%20an%20epidemiologist,the%20cholera%20outbreak%20in%201854.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105112/#:~:text=John%20Snow%20was%20an%20epidemiologist,the%20cholera%20outbreak%20in%201854.)). As the 19th century lagged in advanced qualitative methods that many now take for granted, this is what would be known as the dark ages of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ([All Answers Ltd., 2018](https://ukdiss.com/examples/geographic-information-system.php) & [Ali, 2020](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340182760_Geographic_Information_System_GIS_Definition_Development_Applications_Components)). Only a near hundred years later did GIS come out of the dark ages when Rogers Tomlinson, the father of GIS, computerized the way field experts work with and analyze spatial data ([ESRI, n.d.](https://esripress.esri.com/storage/esripress/images/188/115391_webgis_chapter01.pdf)). Shortly afterwards, American Geographer Waldo Tobler conceived what would be hailed as Tobler's first law of geography (TFL). The creation of TFL emphasized the influence of location where near things are more related than distant things ([Foresman, Luscombe, 2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17538947.2016.1275830)) Even with all the advances that were taking place in the field of GIS, many of the applications used were standalone until 1993 when Xerox developed the first Web-based map viewer. Having GIS on the web opened many doors to mass sharing of information on a global-scale, new user experiences, cross-platform compatibility, and other geospatial services ([ESRI, n.d.](https://esripress.esri.com/storage/esripress/images/188/115391_webgis_chapter01.pdf)). The appeal to use Web-based GIS applications does not only apply to Geographers. In many forms of interdisciplinary research, the diverse field of Geography proves most useful. Through use of GIS, researchers can utilize web GIS platforms and software to better analyze, conceptualize, and interpret information. Regardless of the discipline research is being conducted in, [Regardless of the discipline in which research is conducted] if the research data contains spatial components then GIS will be there as a major facilitator in some form ([Rickles, et al., 2017](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.46)). 

##### The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Move to Remote Work

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the lives of billions around the globe. As such, the ongoing tensions caused by the pandemic has also revealed how unprepared governments are for a global pandemic of this scale ([Timmis, and Brussow, 2020](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.15029)). Matters are made worse by the fact that large, and even small-scale problems are difficult for humans to conceptualize and prepare for. This is especially true when we consider global issues like global warming ([Resnik et al., 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12388)). For example, even with all the warnings emphasized by Canada's pandemic preparedness report ([Federal Government of Canada, 2006](https://www.longwoods.com/articles/images/Canada_Pandemic_Influenza.pdf)), medical supplies (e.g. PPE) were limited and health systems were not adequately suited to handle spikes in hospital admissions ([Eggertson, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145370/)). Canada's early response in the first wave of lockdowns had travel and social interactions restricted, and testing / tracing capacity increased. Such an approach may not have been enough to reduce the number of new cases as time went on since policies are constantly evolving. So, to further combat the waves of community-acquired transmission, decision makers need to look towards various forms o∆íf intervention, such as case detection, isolation, contact tracing, quarantining, and physical distancing **(fix this later)**. Through imposing restrictive measures, transmission across Canada had reduced, so long as controls were not eased ([Ng, et al., 2020](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/37/E1053)). The restrictive measures set forth by policy makers has left the workforce in an entirely new landscape. Employers were forced to quickly adapt to have employees work from home (WFH), serve as essential, or simply be laid-off ([Kniffin et al., 2020](https://doi.apa.org/fulltext/2020-58612-001.html)). One might hypothesize, based on rising trends ([Felstead & Henseke, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ntwe.12097)), many jobs in the digital sphere were already heading towards optionally remote or completely remote before the catalytic event that is the COVID-19 pandemic. [Felstead and Henseke (2017) stated that many jobs in the digital sphere were already heading towards optionally remote or completely remote (cite). This is even more evident now that COVID-19 has drastically reduced the number of people working in an office setting.]
The new normal of working from home may allow employers to focus more on merits and qualifications of their candidates rather than whether they live in a certain city. The geographical hurdles once faced by a company's growth and operations, or a person's career choices may become a thing of the past since employers can focus on offering flexible working arrangements ([McCausland, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08956308.2020.1813506)). The current confinement / restrictions set in place for businesses and academic institutions have left many scrambling for effective communicative and collaborative tools ([Brynes et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ca.23649)). Later in the paper, the GIS Simulation Explorer will be touched on as a remotely accessible collaborative tool for practitioners, and other decision makers.

##### GIS Web Applications for Reducing COVID-19 Spread Through Remote Collaboration 

Since the inception of TFL, researchers in the GIS community have employed such a concept to describe spatial dependence ([Leitner et al., 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323419139_Laws_of_Geography)). In the field of epidemiology, one could apply TFL to synthetically simulate the spread of infectious diseases in a geographical environment based on spatial weighting ([Zhong et al., 2009](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Song_Dunjiang/publication/226204125_Simulation_of_the_spread_of_infectious_diseases_in_a_geographical_environment/links/00b495316b307a20ab000000/Simulation-of-the-spread-of-infectious-diseases-in-a-geographical-environment.pdf)). Such an application can play a vital role in disease prevention and control when coupled with modern spatio-temporal analysis techniques ([Watkins et al., 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1805744/)). When supplementing existing research on virus spread models, geographical tracking and mapping of pandemic data through the application of GIS has been proven to be a powerful system for disease monitoring and planning ([Buolos & Geraghty, 2020](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8)). Such a system allows researchers to present large volumes of data in an intuitive way. For one, web-based mapping has created an environment for accessible remote collaboration between decision makers ([Franch-Pardo et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720335531)). By integrating simulation models into map-based web applications, researchers can also highlight spatio-temporal trends in various scenarios. Highlighting spatio-temporal trends would mean that researcher can observe the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases to drive better policy decisions ([Shariati, et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40201-020-00565-x)).

##### Application of the GIS Simulation Explorer 

Modern open-source GIS libraries, such as OpenLayers, provide developers with the necessary tools to load and display data into dynamic map-based web applications. OpenLayers is entirely free, easy to customize, and supports vector data rendering. D3JS, a lightweight data visualization library, also has some limited mapping capability that could be incorporated into a map-based web application. These web mapping libraries were used to develop the GIS Simulation Explorer application to support current studies of COVID-19 (as well as future pandemics) through remote collaboration. In the application's current state, simulation results are mapped to vector files, and then displayed for observation.

what does it do 
why and how is it useful 
what is it 
future applications and improvements 

Given the unprecedented amount of data surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, local / national / global real-time, non-real-time, or simulated disease cases must be carefully analyzed to recognize high risk geographical regions which may be susceptible to outbreaks or further disease spreading.


(summarize the points to maybe show why software such as this is useful if implemented on a global scale?)

- Where do we fit in? How did we accomplish it?

    Note:

    - The population changes throughout the results file. 

    - The geojson file you loaded would likely have the initial population for the census subdivision.
    
    - The population formula is (population - population * fatalities)
